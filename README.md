# Pixel-Blast-Processing
 Pixel Blast Effect is an interactive visual program created in Processing. When the user clicks anywhere on the canvas, a burst of colorful particles radiates outward, creating a vibrant explosion effect. Each particle moves in a random direction, fades out over time, and adds dynamic visual appeal.
