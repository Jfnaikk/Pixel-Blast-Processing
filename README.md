Pixel Blast Effect

Pixel Blast Effect is an interactive visual art program written in Processing. The program generates a burst of colorful particles when the user clicks anywhere on the canvas. Each particle radiates outward in random directions, gradually fading out over time, creating a dynamic and vibrant explosion effect. Users can also save their creations as a screenshot by pressing the SPACEBAR.

Features
Interactive Pixel Blast: Click anywhere on the canvas to trigger a colorful explosion of pixels.
Dynamic Movement: Each particle moves outward in a random direction with randomized speed and size.
Gradual Fade-Out: Pixels fade away over time, enhancing the animationâ€™s aesthetic.
Screenshot Functionality: Press the SPACEBAR to save the current canvas as a .png file.
On-Screen Instructions: Displays instructions at the bottom of the canvas for user guidance.

How It Works
Setup: The canvas initializes with a black background and waits for user interaction.
Mouse Interaction: Clicking on the canvas creates a pixel blast at the mouse position.

Blast Mechanics:
Each particle (pixel) has a random size, speed, direction, and lifetime.
Particles spread outward from the center of the blast and gradually fade as their lifetime decreases.

Screenshot:
Pressing the SPACEBAR saves the current frame as a .png file in the sketch folder.

Usage
Open the code in the Processing IDE.
Run the program by pressing the play button.
Click anywhere on the canvas to generate a colorful pixel blast.
Press the SPACEBAR to save a screenshot of the current canvas.
File Structure

This project includes the following files:

PixelBlast.pde: The main source code for the simulation.
README.md: Documentation for the project.
Mouse Click: Triggers a pixel blast at the clicked position.
SPACEBAR: Saves a screenshot of the current canvas.
Customization
You can modify the following aspects in the code to personalize the program:

Blast Intensity: Adjust the maxPixels parameter in the PixelBlast class to control the number of particles.
Particle Speed and Size: Modify the speed and size ranges in the Pixel class.
Canvas Size: Change the size() function in the setup() method.
Color Palette: Experiment with the colorMode(HSB) settings in the Pixel.display() method.
